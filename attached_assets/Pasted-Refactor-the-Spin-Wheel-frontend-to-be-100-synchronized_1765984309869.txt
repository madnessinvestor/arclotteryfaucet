Refactor the Spin Wheel frontend to be 100% synchronized with the on-chain contract.

CONTRACT (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Network: Arc Testnet
- Chain ID: 5042002
- Contract address: 0xC33a57Af3BFDB148a8d198Fbe0b457f874519ca9
- Event emitted: SpinPlayed(address player, uint256 reward, uint256 random)

CRITICAL RULE:
The frontend MUST NOT decide or simulate the result.
The contract reward value is the ONLY source of truth.

========================
SPIN FLOW (MANDATORY)
========================

1) When user clicks SPIN:
- Call spin(uint256 random)
- Generate random only to pass to the contract
- DO NOT spin the wheel yet
- Show loading state: "Waiting for blockchain result..."

2) Wait for:
- transaction.wait()
- Parse logs from the SAME transaction receipt
- Find SpinPlayed event for msg.sender

DO NOT:
- Query past events
- Use filters
- Use provider.on listeners

Use ONLY:
receipt.logs + contract.interface.parseLog

3) Extract:
- reward (uint256)

4) AFTER reward is known:
- Start wheel animation
- Spin duration: ~10 seconds
- Ease-out animation
- Wheel must stop EXACTLY on the segment that matches reward

Reward mapping MUST be deterministic:
- 1000 USDC → 1000 segment
- 200 USDC → 200 segment
- 100 USDC → 100 segment
- 50 USDC → 50 segment
- 20 USDC → 20 segment
- 10 USDC → 10 segment
- 0 → NO PRIZE segment

The wheel position must be calculated from the reward value,
not from randomness in the frontend.

========================
UI FEEDBACK
========================

After the wheel stops, show a clear message:

If reward > 0:
- "🎉 Congratulations!"
- "You won X USDC"

If reward == 0:
- "😔 No luck this time"
- "Try again tomorrow"

========================
ERROR HANDLING
========================

If SpinPlayed event is not found:
- Show error: "Spin failed: result not found on-chain"
- Do NOT animate the wheel
- Do NOT show fake result

========================
SPINS LEFT
========================

- Read spinsLeft(address user) directly from contract
- Display "Spins Left Today: X / 20"
- Disable SPIN button if spinsLeft == 0
- Show countdown until reset using:
  - lastReset + 24h (from contract state)

========================
IMPORTANT
========================

- NEVER simulate outcomes in frontend
- NEVER stop the wheel before the contract result
- The wheel must visually reflect EXACTLY what the contract paid
- UX must feel delayed and suspenseful (~10s), but correct

This is a blockchain-driven game. Visuals follow the contract, not the opposite.
