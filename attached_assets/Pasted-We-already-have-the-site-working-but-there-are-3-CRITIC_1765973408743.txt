We already have the site working, but there are 3 CRITICAL issues that must be fixed to be fully aligned with the smart contract and Arc Testnet.

CONTRACT (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- Network: Arc Testnet
- Chain ID (decimal): 5042002
- Chain ID (hex): 0x4CFB32
- RPC: https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
- Explorer: https://testnet.arcscan.app
- Spin contract address:
  0xdB19da3BC195e32685136a63a3B014F74929dE64

The frontend MUST strictly follow the contract behavior.

========================================
1) AUTOMATIC NETWORK SWITCH (MANDATORY)
========================================

Current problem:
- When connecting the wallet, the user must manually switch to Arc Testnet.

Required fix:
- On wallet connection, automatically:
  1) Check the current chainId
  2) If NOT Arc Testnet, call wallet_switchEthereumChain
  3) If the network is not added, fallback to wallet_addEthereumChain

Use these exact parameters:

Chain ID (hex): 0x4CFB32
Chain Name: Arc Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
Native Currency:
  name: USDC
  symbol: USDC
  decimals: 6
Block Explorer: https://testnet.arcscan.app

This must work for MetaMask and Rabby.

========================================
2) DAILY SPIN LIMIT + COUNTDOWN TIMER
========================================

Rules (from contract logic):
- Each wallet can do a maximum of 5 spins per 24 hours.

Current problem:
- The site does not show how much time is left.
- The SPIN button is still active.

Required fix:
- Read from the contract (on-chain) how many spins the connected wallet has already used.
- If spinsUsed >= 5:
  - Disable the SPIN button
  - Show a countdown timer (HH:MM:SS)
  - Timer must be based on the LAST SPIN TIMESTAMP stored in the contract
  - Countdown resets exactly after 24 hours
- When the timer reaches zero:
  - Re-enable the SPIN button automatically

IMPORTANT:
- The timer MUST be derived from contract data, NOT localStorage.
- No frontend-based timers without on-chain reference.

========================================
3) SPIN RESULT MUST MATCH THE CONTRACT (CRITICAL)
========================================

Current problem:
- The wheel animation result does NOT always match the on-chain result.

This is NOT acceptable.

Required fix:
- The smart contract result is the ONLY source of truth.
- The frontend must NOT decide or simulate the reward.

Correct flow:
1) User clicks SPIN
2) Frontend calls the spin function on the contract
3) Wait for transaction confirmation
4) Read the event emitted by the contract (reward / outcome)
5) Map the returned reward to the correct wheel segment
6) Animate the wheel and STOP exactly on that segment

Rules:
- The wheel animation is ONLY visual
- The contract decides the outcome
- The UI must always reflect the on-chain result

========================================
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
========================================

- Use ethers.js
- No backend
- No local random deciding outcomes
- Always sync state from the blockchain
- Code must be clean and well organized
- Keep existing UI/animations, only fix logic and synchronization

Goal:
The site must behave exactly like a real on-chain casino game:
wallet → contract → result → animation → UI update
